company-show-doc-buffer:
    Calls company--electric-do to save window configuration, gets doc-buffer (does not call company-doc-buffer),
    sets other-window-scroll-buffer to it, and calls (display-buffer doc-buffer t)
    * Advise function to get *company-documentation* buffer and call display-buffer to display help for ess in help window
    * Advice to set company--electric-saved-window-configuration to nil (advice C-h when in ess-mode?)

display-buffer buffer-or-name &optional action frame
[display] action: (functions . alist)
    functions can be a single function or a list of functions
function buffer alist
Precedence of display actions:
    display-buffer-overriding-action
    action argument of display-buffer
    display-buffer-base-action
    display-buffer-fallback-action
Steps:
1. display-buffer creates a list of action functions and a combined action alist according to precedence.
1a. Note that this doesn't mention buffer regular expressions used in lieu of functions (see
    display-buffer-alist)
2. It calls the actions functions in order, with the buffer and combined action alist as args,
   until one returns non-nil
