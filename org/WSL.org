* Mounting drvfs drives

[[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/chmod-chown-wsl-improvements/][drvfs]]

Mounting drives is easy, even if they're shared. Contrary to my expectations,
use the drive letters on Windows (H:) rather than the UNC path
(\\dprhq01\EMON_USERS\jkroes).
#+begin_src sh
sudo mount -t drvfs 'A:\VOC' /mnt/voc
sudo mount -t drvfs 'H:' /mnt/h
#+end_src

* Curl

Curl does not work in WSL by default. Run the following code, extract
the last certificate in cacert.pem, and copy it over to
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:

```{sh, eval=F}
echo quit| openssl s_client -showcerts -servername api.github.com -connect api.github.com:443 > cacert.pem
```

Alternatively, you might be able to alias curl as
> curl -cacert /mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

As a last resort, run curl insecurely.
