* TGAs to add to EP database
** Goal Tender, Goal 2XL, Cyclaniliprole 50SL Ornamental Insecticide
** Email query to Brenna, 3 products (8/19/20)
** Four products have been renamed. See comments column.
** Vacciplant (83941-2-66330-AA) is missing an alpha code (AA). Correct typo in CA_regno.
** Amplitude (84059-28-ZA) should have been labeled an ABN linked to 84059-28-ML. Correct typo in ep_meth_desc, comment_without_date, and bridged_regno

***** WAITING 060120/No_Fumigant_Codes.xlsx
- State "WAITING"    from "TODO"       [2020-08-20 Thu 14:49] \\
  May only be applicable to the annual report. Nonreporting is up and a statement
  needs to be present in the relevant report about % of fumigant applications
  missing a valid fumigant code.
**** TODO Edits from management
**** TODO VOC listserv / stakeholder email
Minh seems to be handling stakeholder emails for report publication, but I
believe I still need to send them out for the EP database updates and VOC calculator.

*** TODO Check hypothetical emissions
**** DONE Does annual report script use lbs AI or product?       :ARCHIVE:
It uses lbs AI in Rmd report.
**** DONE What about past workbooks?                             :ARCHIVE:
CLOSED: [2020-08-19 Wed 13:34]
Yes, the regulations and Focus4_and_the_Magnificent7 workbooks are consistent in
using lbs_AI
**** DONE Does your earlier .Rmd analysis of hypothetical emissions still make sense? :ARCHIVE:
CLOSED: [2020-08-19 Wed 13:34]
I believe I suggested that dividing emissions by mass yields average
EP of a product containing an AI. But this assumes we use product
mass, since emissions and EP are product-wide.This analysis is thus only valid
for VOC/applied metric in one focus4 table and not for hypothetical emissions.
**** TODO Why did hypothetical emissions calculation decide to use lbs_AI and not lbs?
Average EP for nonfumigants can only be gained by dividing emissions by product
lbs. See Emissions.html
*** TODO Evaluation database [75%]
**** DONE Presentation to management                             :ARCHIVE:
***** DONE Minh suggests including all excluded fields except fo reviewer title
**** DONE Create RShiny application for data entry
**** DONE Decision for Registration on changing TGA eval forms
CLOSED: [2020-08-19 Wed 12:48]
**** DONE Create Rmarkdown evaluation forms                      :ARCHIVE:
***** DONE Create long form for Air Program
***** DONE Create abridged form for Registration
**** TODO Add Shiny and evaluation db to inventory's procedures
Thoughts: Selecting only the most recent record for repeat
submissions. Write a custom import script or manually copy desired
records.
**** TODO Flag products that are missing evaluations
**** TODO Flag evals that are missing entries in db
*** TODO Version Control System
**** DONE Add git bare repo to serve invnetory scripts.
**** DONE Add git bare repo for annual report scripts and those used to make script input datasets.
**** TODO Reinstall Git for Windows and move repo to A:/
**** TODO Add instructions for using repo
**** TODO Add tags for each inventory run
E.g., "2018PrelimDraft"
*** TODO Registration
**** TODO Finish updating evaluation guidelines
**** TODO Document ongoing projects and consolidate meeting notes and emails from Registration
**** TODO SOP for Air Program-Registration data process, in particular ABNs and product transfers
** Long-term
*** VOC report updates
**** TODO Modularize through source() or child
**** TODO Refactor ggplot2 code
**** TODO Discussion and updates around chlorpyrifos?
**** TODO Update procedures
***** Filenames and SAS scripts no longer have redundant dates as of 6/2019
***** Status code for TGA tracker
*** Convert inventory guidelines to markdown and version control
*** Script rewrites
**** Topics
***** Unadjusted emissions
****** Two scripts calculate unadjusted fumigant emissions differently,
one of which is used for adjusted emissions. Need to confirm that
scripts' results are the same for these fumigants, or else how
differences affect final inventory results and whether to rewrite.
See "D:\EmissionsCalcs.docx";
"D:\EmissionsCalculationAnalaysis.xlsx";
Compare_Unadjusted_Calcs.sas
***** Adjusted emissions (A/VOC/Procedures/Adjusted emissions.docx)
***** Errors in aggregated totals
****** Seen in AI and site-AI totals, and in differences between mebr
and nonmber datasets. See Rmarkdown report, roadmap, and
procedural document for report.

In general, aggregation should be done as late as possible in
the data process to avoid loss of information and unnecessary
early splitting of a dataset into multiples, which increases
the risk of truncation and other i/o errors. Aggregation
across one group of factors should be done only once for each
dataset.
*** SOP for updating inventory inputs
*** Script to identify Focus-4 products
*** Update flowchart to reflect new inventory process, once finalized
**** Add to inventory script git repo
** Miscellaneous
*** Statewide calculations
*** Organize archived historical files
** Recurring
*** TGA reviews
**** Add and populate bridge-indicator variable in EP database and tracking sheet
***** For information on past bridges, see evaluations, past tracking sheets, and comment variables in the EP and tracking sheets
**** Archive submissions to evalreports
/mnt/a/VOC/19VOC/Procedures/Registration_and_Evaluation/
**** Keep a running list of products to add to each inventory run
*** Focus 4 lists
**** Record changes that should be added to the VOC inventory
**** ADA conversion for each list
**** IT ticket to post each list
*** Product name and regno update letters from Brenna
**** Add to product evaluation file to help check filename (CA regno) with contents
