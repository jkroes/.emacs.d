CLOSED: [2020-07-16 Thu 15:14]
***** DONE Interpret existing procedures to generate data submission
***** DONE Burn to CD
***** DONE Submit to ARB
**** TODO Archive folders that have changed
**** TODO Update procedures
**** TODO VOC listserv / stakeholder email
*** TODO Check hypothetical emissions
**** DONE Does annual report script use lbs AI or product?       :ARCHIVE:
It uses lbs AI in Rmd report.
**** TODO What about past master workbooks?
**** TODO Does your earlier .Rmd analysis of hypothetical emissions still make sense?
I believe I suggested that dividing emissions by mass yields average
EP of a product containing an AI. But this assumes we use product
mass, since emissions and EP are product-wide. If we use mass of AI,
I'm not sure what the resulting EP metric represents, if anything.
*** TODO Evaluation database [75%]
**** DONE Presentation to management                             :ARCHIVE:
***** DONE Minh suggests including all excluded fields except fo reviewer title
**** DONE Create RShiny application for data entry
**** DONE Create Rmarkdown evaluation forms                      :ARCHIVE:
***** DONE Create long form for Air Program
***** DONE Create abridged form for Registration
**** TODO Update TGA guidelines
**** TODO Update VOC inventory procedures
Thoughts: Selecting only the most recent record for repeat
submissions. Write a custom import script or manually copy desired
records.
*** TODO Version Control System
**** DONE Add git bare repo to serve invnetory scripts.
**** DONE Add git bare repo for annual report scripts and those used to make script input datasets.
**** TODO Reinstall Git for Windows and move repo to A:/
**** TODO Add instructions for using repo
**** TODO Add tags for each inventory run
E.g., "2018PrelimDraft"
*** TODO Registration
**** TODO Decision for Registration on changing TGA eval forms
**** TODO Eval database template
***** TODO Flag products that are missing evaluations
***** TODO Flag evals that are missing entries in db
**** TODO Finish updating evaluation guidelines
**** TODO Document ongoing projects and consolidate meeting notes and emails from Registration
**** TODO SOP for Air Program-Registration data process, in particular ABNs and product transfers
** Long-term
*** Convert inventory guidelines to markdown and version control
*** Script rewrites
**** Topics
***** Unadjusted emissions
****** Two scripts calculate unadjusted fumigant emissions differently,
one of which is used for adjusted emissions. Need to confirm that
scripts' results are the same for these fumigants, or else how
differences affect final inventory results and whether to rewrite.
See "D:\EmissionsCalcs.docx";
"D:\EmissionsCalculationAnalaysis.xlsx";
Compare_Unadjusted_Calcs.sas
***** Adjusted emissions (A/VOC/Procedures/Adjusted emissions.docx)
***** Errors in aggregated totals
****** Seen in AI and site-AI totals, and in differences between mebr
and nonmber datasets. See Rmarkdown report, roadmap, and
procedural document for report.

In general, aggregation should be done as late as possible in
the data process to avoid loss of information and unnecessary
early splitting of a dataset into multiples, which increases
the risk of truncation and other i/o errors. Aggregation
across one group of factors should be done only once for each
dataset.
