* TGA Evaluations (7/31/20)
** SAS
- Did SAS Univeristy work?
- Studying SAS resources
- Oracle database access
** Evaluation guidelines
- Difference between EP, rog, and tog
  - Appendix A
  - inorganic carbon compound subtraction
- Submission form (p.2)
  - USEPA vs. CA regnos
  - Three replicates
  - Reg # components (p. 3)
    - Product transfer, subreg., ABN, AB1011, 100% repack ("bridges")
      - ABN = CA revision code
      - USEPA = ABNs have same regno
        - https://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=113:5:::NO
      - See p.6 for subreg evaluations
  - % water (= % ingredient * % water in ingredient on CSF; p.4)
  - Exempted compounds
    - Verifying claims by registrants on TGA submission form
  - Product file (CSF) vs. data volume (TGA submission/thermograms)
    - Reg. Resource Library, different  desks
- Thermograms (p. 5)
  - Error: "EP uncorrected for water content is defined as total loss at end of
    15-minute period." Ignores exempt. Should say "Mass loss is measured at the
    end of the 15-minute period."
  - Error: "minimum run time is 35 minutes." Should say "36 minutes."
  - Temperature may not be indicated
  - Mass loss may not be indicated
    - Slope calculations over final 15-minute period. See Figures 2,3.
  - 115C
    - End test after 96 minutes if stabilization fails
    - Request 55C
- Completing evaluation form (p.6)
  - RShiny app now. Docno, prodno may be missing.
- P. 13 form is incorrect. Why?
- P. 14. Show more recent example of evaluations
- Inventory uses rog and tog
- Thermograms
  - Figures 1-3: mass loss vs mass loss rate. end of 5 vs 15 minute period.
  - Figure 4: 80 minutes after 16 minute warm-up, not 80 minutes total
  - Figure 5: Just an example of 55C test and total runtime
  - Figure 7: What is thermal decomposition?
- Appendix C: CSF Analysis and legacy methods
** Torac rejection
** RShiny

* Post-meeting Notes

Yvan has concerns about laboratory procedures and statistical validation. In
particular, he mentioned that with ecological data he would usually look at
multiple graphs and run statistical tests to validate his data. The use of a
single graph concerns/confuses him. I pointed out that we do average triplicate
runs together, but that we don't currently vet the laboratories or confirm
they're following the procedures aside from clues on the submission forms and
thermograms.

** TODO Search for historical documents/memos related to TGA methodology development for Yvan
*** Maziar recommends we wait on trying to get into statistical methodology and stick with arithmetic mean of replicates for now
** TODO Recuit Rosemary to help with guideline revisions
*** TODO Rosemary pointed out that multiple images listed an initial mass that didn't match the mass listed on the example thermograms
*** TODO Some thermograms list temperature toward the top-left, which should be pointed out as a potential verification of lab procedures
