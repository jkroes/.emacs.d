* TGA Evaluations (7/31/20)
** SAS
- Did SAS Univeristy work?
- Studying SAS resources
- Oracle database access
** Evaluation guidelines
- Difference between EP, rog, and tog
  - Appendix A
  - inorganic carbon compound subtraction
- Submission form (p.2)
  - USEPA vs. CA regnos
  - Three replicates
  - Reg # components (p. 3)
    - Product transfer, subreg., ABN, AB1011, 100% repack ("bridges")
      - ABN = CA revision code
      - USEPA = ABNs have same regno
        - https://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=113:5:::NO
      - See p.6 for subreg evaluations
  - % water (= % ingredient * % water in ingredient on CSF; p.4)
  - Exempted compounds
    - Verifying claims by registrants on TGA submission form
  - Product file (CSF) vs. data volume (TGA submission/thermograms)
    - Reg. Resource Library, different  desks
- Thermograms (p. 5)
  - Error: "EP uncorrected for water content is defined as total loss at end of
    15-minute period." Ignores exempt. Should say "Mass loss is measured at the
    end of the 15-minute period."
  - Error: "minimum run time is 35 minutes." Should say "36 minutes."
  - Temperature may not be indicated
  - Mass loss may not be indicated
    - Slope calculations over final 15-minute period. See Figures 2,3.
  - 115C
    - End test after 96 minutes if stabilization fails
    - Request 55C
- Completing evaluation form (p.6)
  - RShiny app now. Docno, prodno may be missing.
- P. 13 form is incorrect. Why?
- P. 14. Show more recent example of evaluations
- Inventory uses rog and tog
- Thermograms
  - Figures 1-3: mass loss vs mass loss rate. end of 5 vs 15 minute period.
  - Figure 4: 80 minutes after 16 minute warm-up, not 80 minutes total
  - Figure 5: Just an example of 55C test and total runtime
  - Figure 7: What is thermal decomposition?
- Appendix C: CSF Analysis and legacy methods
** Torac rejection
** RShiny
