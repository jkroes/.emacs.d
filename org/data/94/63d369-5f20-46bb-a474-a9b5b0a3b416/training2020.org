* TGA Evaluations (7/31/20)
** SAS
- Studying SAS resources
*** Oracle database access
*** Did SAS Univeristy work?
Couldn't be installed by IT due to licensing issues.
** Evaluation guidelines
- Difference between EP, rog, and tog
  - Appendix A
  - inorganic carbon compound subtraction
- Submission form (p.2)
  - USEPA vs. CA regnos
  - Three replicates
  - Reg # components (p. 3)
    - Product transfer, subreg., ABN, AB1011, 100% repack ("bridges")
      - ABN = CA revision code
      - USEPA = ABNs have same regno
        - https://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=113:5:::NO
      - See p.6 for subreg evaluations
  - % water (= % ingredient * % water in ingredient on CSF; p.4)
  - Exempted compounds
    - Verifying claims by registrants on TGA submission form
  - Product file (CSF) vs. data volume (TGA submission/thermograms)
    - Reg. Resource Library, different  desks
- Thermograms (p. 5)
  - Error: "EP uncorrected for water content is defined as total loss at end of
    15-minute period." Ignores exempt. Should say "Mass loss is measured at the
    end of the 15-minute period."
  - Error: "minimum run time is 35 minutes." Should say "36 minutes."
  - Temperature may not be indicated
  - Mass loss may not be indicated
    - Slope calculations over final 15-minute period. See Figures 2,3.
  - 115C
    - End test after 96 minutes if stabilization fails
    - Request 55C
- Completing evaluation form (p.6)
  - RShiny app now. Docno, prodno may be missing.
- P. 13 form is incorrect. Why?
- P. 14. Show more recent example of evaluations
- Inventory uses rog and tog
- Thermograms
  - Figures 1-3: mass loss vs mass loss rate. end of 5 vs 15 minute period.
  - Figure 4: 80 minutes after 16 minute warm-up, not 80 minutes total
  - Figure 5: Just an example of 55C test and total runtime
  - Figure 7: What is thermal decomposition?
- Appendix C: CSF Analysis and legacy methods
* Post-meeting Notes
Yvan has concerns about laboratory procedures and statistical validation. In
particular, he mentioned that with ecological data he would usually look at
multiple graphs and run statistical tests to validate his data. The use of a
single graph concerns/confuses him. I pointed out that we do average triplicate
runs together, but that we don't currently vet the laboratories or confirm
they're following the procedures aside from clues on the submission forms and
thermograms.

** TODO Search for historical documents/memos related to TGA methodology development for Yvan
Maziar recommends we wait on trying to get into statistical methodology and stick with arithmetic mean of replicates for now
** TODO Recuit Rosemary to help with guideline revisions
*** TODO Rosemary pointed out that multiple images listed an initial mass that didn't match the mass listed on the example thermograms
*** TODO Some thermograms list temperature toward the top-left, which should be pointed out as a potential verification of lab procedures
* TGA Evaluations (8/4/20)
- Discussed the guidelines and thermogram examples.

** TODO Yvan and Rosemary will need to run some example TGAs when possible
* Steps 1-2 (8/18/20)
- SAS and Oracle are up and running. Rosemary O'Neal and Maziar transferred
  their SAS licenses.
- Beginning training on how to build the EP database.
  - Sent them the following evaluations:
    - Cyclaniliprole 50SL Insecticide
    - Stimulate Yield Enhancer (existing record)
    - Loyant CA
    - Gibbmaxx
    - Bexar Insecticide
    - Torac CA Insecticide
    - Vacciplant (existing record)
    - Stargus
    - MBI-110EP
    - Amplitude
    - Amplitude ST
    - Ascernity
    - Gatten
    - ProcellaCor EC
    - Sunergist EBR
    - Trivapro Fungicide
  - I noted that normally pending products would be checked, but that I was
    sending them all product (new and updates to pending/existing products)
    evaluations of interest
- They are aware that the procedural changes and changes to SAS scripts related
  to filenames have not been documented and are only present in 19VOC. They will
  continue working with 11.2019 and 18VOC data as the basis for recreating 2019
  SJV report.
- Asked them to CC each other on emails to me and send me their completed files.
* 8/19/2
- Points of confusion for Yvan:
  - EPA Reg No on eval form, CA_regno and voc_regno in workbook
    - Need to distinguish between fully and partially completed values for
      columns when explaining purposes of columns. Part of the confusion
      involved not being clear when I was saying what a column should contain
      vs. what it will contain. E.g., voc_regno is the first two components of
      regno when a product is registered, but sometimes pending federal products
      only have a firm no. Also there may be typos that further confuse
      incomplete vs. wrong info.
    - Number of records in tracker and how to "filter" them to check if an
      evaluation is a new product. I realized I had told them some of the
      evaluations were new but not which ones. I corrected this.
    - He was unaware what the CDPR product label database was. I referenced it,
      but he hadn't asked about it yet.
    - Whether review date was registration date or evaluation form date.
  - Relationship between Column A (prodno) and Columns N thru P. Specifically
    whether missing prodno is associated with "Not Found" for the latter.
