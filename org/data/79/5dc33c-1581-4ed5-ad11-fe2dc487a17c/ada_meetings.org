** Biggest challenges of ADA Process
- Tables require a lot of effort, especially when the table editor is required
  - Nested row and column headers
  - Merged cells
  - References and foonotes
- When a page prevents you from tagging it, remove the page and try
  again. Sometimes this will fix the issue.
- IT is identifying issues with our ADA documents through the PDF reader
  tool. Using that can give you an idea of potential roadblocks to approval of
  your document.
